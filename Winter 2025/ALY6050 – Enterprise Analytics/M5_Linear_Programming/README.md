# Module 5 – Linear Programming: Profit Maximization



## Overview

This project applies linear programming to maximize profits for a company planning a new distribution center. The model considers product-level profit contributions, budget constraints, and resource limitations.



## Contents

- `src/` – R script formulating and solving the LP problem

- `docs/` – Report describing assumptions, formulation, and solution



## Methods

- Definition of decision variables for product quantities

- Formulation of objective function (maximize total profit)

- Linear constraints for budget, warehouse space, and product limitations

- Solution using LP solver functions in R



## Key Insight

Linear programming enables optimal allocation of resources to maximize profitability within operational constraints.
