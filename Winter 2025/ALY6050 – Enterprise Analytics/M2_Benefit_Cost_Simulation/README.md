# Module 2 – Monte Carlo Simulation: Benefit-Cost Analysis



## Overview

This project applies Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate and compare projects under uncertainty. Each project’s benefits and costs are modeled with probability distributions and simulated over many iterations. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is then calculated for each scenario.



## Contents

- `src/` – R scripts for random number generation and simulation

- `docs/` – Final report (PDF) with analysis and results



## Methods

- Random number generation and distribution fitting

- Simulation of project benefits and costs using triangular distribution

- Calculation of benefit-cost ratio (BCR)

- Decision rule: select project with BCR greater than 1 and maximum relative advantage



## Key Insight

Simulation allows risk-adjusted comparison of projects beyond simple deterministic cost-benefit estimates.
