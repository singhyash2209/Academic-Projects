\# Module 6 – Transshipment and Portfolio Optimization



\## Overview

This final project combines two optimization problems:

1\. A transshipment model for optimizing hazardous waste transportation across a network.

2\. A quadratic programming model for portfolio optimization based on risk-return trade-offs.



\## Contents

\- `src/` – R scripts implementing transshipment and portfolio optimization

\- `docs/` – Report summarizing problem setup, models, and results



\## Methods

\- Network flow optimization using transshipment modeling

\- Cost minimization subject to route and capacity constraints

\- Portfolio optimization using mean-variance framework

\- Quadratic programming to balance risk and expected return



\## Key Insight

Operations research methods such as network flow and portfolio optimization provide practical solutions in logistics and finance.
