# Module 4 – Inventory Optimization (EOQ Model)



## Overview

This project develops a prescriptive model for an inventory management problem. The analysis applies the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model to minimize total costs under different demand and cost structures. Scenarios with and without uncertainty are evaluated.



## Contents

- `src/` – R script implementing EOQ calculations

- `data/` – Provided Excel dataset for cost and demand

- `docs/` – Final report with model results



## Methods

- Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) calculations

- Holding cost and ordering cost trade-off analysis

- Optimization under deterministic and uncertain demand

- Sensitivity analysis for decision support



## Key Insight

Prescriptive analytics helps determine when and how much to order, reducing costs while maintaining service levels.
