\## Overview

This project applies time series forecasting methods to stock price data for Apple (AAPL) and Honeywell (HON). The analysis includes smoothing methods, regression approaches, and error metrics to assess predictive accuracy.



\## Contents

\- `src/` – R scripts implementing forecasting models

\- `docs/` – Final report with analysis and results



\## Methods

\- Weighted Moving Average (WMA)

\- Exponential Smoothing

\- Regression analysis using linear algebra

\- Error evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and other norms



\## Key Insight

Combining smoothing methods with regression models provides a basis for robust short-term forecasting in financial time series.
