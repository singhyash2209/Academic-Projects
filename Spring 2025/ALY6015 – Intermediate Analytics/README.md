# ALY6015 – Intermediate Analytics



This course covers regression diagnostics, logistic regression, and linear-model regularization, culminating in an integrated final project.



## Modules



- **M1 – Regression Diagnostics (Ames Housing)**  

&nbsp; Multiple linear regression; assumption checks (linearity, normality, equal variance); leverage/influence; multicollinearity; model comparison.



- **M3 – Logistic Regression**  

&nbsp; Binary classification pipeline; feature prep; model fit; coefficient/odds interpretation; confusion matrix; ROC/AUC.



- **M4 – Regularization (Ridge & LASSO)**  

&nbsp; Standardization; cross-validated λ; coefficient shrinkage/selection; generalization error.



- **Final Project – Integrated**  

&nbsp; End-to-end: EDA → model selection (GLM/logit) → diagnostics → interpretation & reporting.



## Dataset Sources

- **Ames Housing**: public dataset popular for regression diagnostics.  

- **College (ISLR)**: https://rdrr.io/cran/ISLR/man/College.html  

- **Final project data**: `drugs_side_effects_drugs_com.xlsx` (publicly sourced).



## Repo Layout

Each module has `data/`, `docs/`, `src/`, and `visuals/`.  

Large binary data is managed with Git LFS.
