# Project 4 — Independent Data Analysis (ALY6000)



**Topic:** Leafly Cannabis Strain Analysis  

**Course:** ALY6000 — Intro to Analytics (Fall 2024)  

**Deliverables:** R script (`src/Singh_Project4.R`), slide deck (`docs/Singh_Project4.pptx`).



## What I did

- Cleaned raw strain records (types, THC %, terpene names), handled NAs, normalized datatypes.

- Summarized THC distribution, strain-type mix, and terpene prevalence.

- Built bar charts/box plots for type distribution and THC by type; compared top terpenes.

## Data
- *Leafly Cannabis Strain Data* (Kaggle). If large, download from Kaggle and place locally under `data/`.
  - Kaggle: gthrosa/leafly-cannabis-strains-metadata
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gthrosa/leafly-cannabis-strains-metadata?resource=download

## How to run
1. Open `src/Singh_Project4.R` in RStudio.
2. Install packages on first run (comment out `install.packages` before commit).
3. Set working directory to the project root.
4. Knit/Run to reproduce figures.

## Notes
- Built to satisfy Project 4 requirements (cleaning + EDA + storytelling slides).
