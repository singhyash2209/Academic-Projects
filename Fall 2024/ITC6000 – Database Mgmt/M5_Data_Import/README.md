\# M5 – Data Import \& Implementation



\### Objective

Translate the ERD into an actual database, populate it with data, and demonstrate SQL queries.  

This module bridges design and implementation, showing practical SQL execution.



\### Deliverables

\- \*\*Database files (/db)\*\*

&nbsp; - `week\_5project.db` (SQLite database)  

&nbsp; - `week\_5project.sqbpro` (SQLite project file)  

\- \*\*Reports (/docs)\*\*

&nbsp; - \*Module\_5\_Report.pdf\* – 2-page architecture report describing client/server setup, storage, and hosting decisions.  

&nbsp; - \*Week5\_Sql\_Select\_Statements.pdf\* – Full set of executed SQL queries (20+).  

&nbsp; - \*(Week5\_Sql\_Select\_Statements-1.pdf)\* – Extended or duplicate query set if required.  



\### Key Highlights

\- Updated ERD with PK/FK relationships using crow’s-foot notation.  

\- Implemented `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` statements in SQLite.  

\- At least 20 meaningful SQL queries involving joins across 2+ tables.  

\- Architecture overview: storage, hosting model (cloud vs local), and client/server communication.
