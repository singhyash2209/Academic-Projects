# M5 – Data Import & Implementation



### Objective

Translate the ERD into an actual database, populate it with data, and demonstrate SQL queries.  

This module bridges design and implementation, showing practical SQL execution.



### Deliverables

- **Database files (/db)**

&nbsp; - `week_5project.db` (SQLite database)  

&nbsp; - `week_5project.sqbpro` (SQLite project file)  

- **Reports (/docs)**

&nbsp; - *Module_5_Report.pdf* – 2-page architecture report describing client/server setup, storage, and hosting decisions.  

&nbsp; - *Week5_Sql_Select_Statements.pdf* – Full set of executed SQL queries (20+).  

&nbsp; - *(Week5_Sql_Select_Statements-1.pdf)* – Extended or duplicate query set if required.  



### Key Highlights

- Updated ERD with PK/FK relationships using crow’s-foot notation.  

- Implemented `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` statements in SQLite.  

- At least 20 meaningful SQL queries involving joins across 2+ tables.  

- Architecture overview: storage, hosting model (cloud vs local), and client/server communication.
